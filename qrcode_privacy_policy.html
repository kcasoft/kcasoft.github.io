    <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
    <p>
      Our Service requires the customer to give the app CAMERA permission so
      that the app can decode QR codes by opening the camera just for this
      purpose. We do NOT collect any CAMERA related information.

    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
    <p>
      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as
      anonymous unique identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>This Service does not use these “cookies”.</p>
    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
    <p>
      We do NOT collect any information that is to be secured. The anonymus
      personal information we gather is still secured. However, the user of the
      app does not need to worry about this, as it has no identifiable personal
      information.

      These Services do not address anyone under the age of 3. We do not
      knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under
      3. In the case we discover that a child under 3 has provided us with
      personal information in any way, we immediately discard this. If you are a
      parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with
      personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do
      necessary actions.
